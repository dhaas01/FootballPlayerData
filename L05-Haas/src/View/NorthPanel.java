/*You will implement a search function to search for data in the Data Table.

The user will type a search term on a JTextField in the North Panel.

The table has to be sorted by whatever field the user will choose to perform the search by.
the search term is found in the table
the line with the search term then will be placed at the top of the displayed table
if the line is towards the end of the table and can't be placed at the top, just make sure that it is displayed on the current screen
the line with the search term should be highlighted
the search term is not found in the table
the search field will be set to red
and JTextField object, for instance, tf1, can be set to have a red background with
tf1.setOpaque(true)
tf1.setBackground(Color.red);
You will need an Action Listener in the search JTextField. The actionListener is triggered by the user hitting ENTER.

You need to search by the HashMap key.

You will not search the Hash Map sequentially because this doesn't make sense.

Using the key the Hash Map gives you the object that was searched. There is no need to read 
all the objects in the Hash Map then. So, it is a requirement that you use the Hash Table 
properly and this will be part of your grading.
it is the panel in charge of letting the user type the search term
it has a JTextField
the user has to hit <ENTER> to trigger the search
the JTextField needs an ActionListener to detect the <ENTER> hit*/
